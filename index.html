  <h1>Churchly – Child Safety & Content Standards</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> November 13, 2025</p>

  <p>
    At <strong>Churchly</strong>, developed and published by <strong>Swiftmindapps</strong>,
    we are deeply committed to protecting the safety and well-being of all users, especially
    children. These standards outline our firm stance against any form of
    <strong>Child Sexual Abuse and Exploitation (CSAE)</strong> and our broader child safety practices.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Zero-Tolerance Policy Toward CSAE</h2>
  <p>
    Churchly strictly prohibits the creation, sharing, or distribution of
    <strong>Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM)</strong>, grooming, exploitation, or any behavior
    that endangers minors. Any such activity results in the immediate removal of the content,
    suspension of related accounts, and reporting to appropriate law-enforcement authorities.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Safe-Use Standards</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>We do not permit any form of sexually explicit or exploitative content involving minors.</li>
    <li>We prohibit harassment, bullying, or harmful behavior toward children.</li>
    <li>We restrict access to certain features for underage users when applicable.</li>
    <li>We encourage parents and guardians to supervise and guide children’s app usage.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Developer Responsibility</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Swiftmindapps</strong>, the developer of <strong>Churchly</strong>, ensures that
    all updates, community features, and user interactions comply with Google Play’s
    <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9876937" target="_blank">Child Safety Standards Policy</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Reporting Violations</h2>
  <p>
    If you encounter content or behavior that may violate these standards, please report it
    immediately to our support team:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Email: <a href="mailto:swiftmindapps@gmail.com">swiftmindapps@gmail.com</a></li>
    <li>Subject line: <em>Child Safety Concern – Churchly</em></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Continuous Review</h2>
  <p>
    These standards are regularly reviewed and updated to remain compliant with
    Google Play’s Child Safety Standards and applicable global child protection laws.
